    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the efficiency ratio<br> 
    What is the efficiency ratio?<br>
    The efficiency ratio is a measurement of the firm's ability to use it's assets to generate income. The efficiency ratio takes into account various aspects of the firm including the time required to collectcash from customers.<br>
    How to calculate efficiency ratio?<br>
    To calculate efficiency ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    efficiency ratio = non interest operating costs / (net interest income + non interest income + provision for credit losses)<br>
    example: Bank x has a total interest income of $30,000,000, $8,000,000 in non interest income, the provision for credit losses was $1,300,000 and $15,000,000 worth of non interest operating costs, measure the efficiency ratio?<br>
    using the efficiency ratio the answer will be:<br>
    efficiency ratio = non interest operating costs / (net interest income + non interest income + provision for credit losses)<br>
    efficiency ratio = $15,000,000 / ($30,000,000 + $8,000,000 + $1,300,000)<br>
    efficiency ratio = 40.87%<br>
    Why use efficiency ratio?<br>
    The efficiency ratio is usually used because it helps in analyzing how well the firm is in using it's assets and liabilities internally.<br>
